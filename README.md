From Imperative to Functional APIs
==================================

These are the slides of a talk held on the 28th of March 2015 at LambdaConf.
They are an enhanced and revised variant of the slides of
[6th of August 2013](http://www.meetup.com/Munich-Lambda/events/126916132/) at
[Lambda Munich](http://www.meetup.com/Munich-Lambda/).

The content is CC BY licensed, so use it as you like. It'd be cool if you'd let
me know what you're doing but is of course optional.

If you just want to see them, a version without transitions (handout-style) can
be found on
[Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/leonidas/from-imperative-to-functional-apis),
its content is identical to the 1.0 git tag of this repo.
